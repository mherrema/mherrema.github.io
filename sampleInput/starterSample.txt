This is a sample input for the "starter" web browser I provided.

It should render single, marked words in *bold* type.
(Notice that it also removes the markup.)

Clicking on a color link like the ones below should change the text color:
(#FF0000)
(#00FF00)
(#0000FF)

(But notice that the color changes aren't permanent).
